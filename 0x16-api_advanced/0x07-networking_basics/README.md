#### Networking Basics Project

## Description
This project is aimed at understanding fundamental concepts in networking such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, as well as TCP and UDP protocols.

## Tasks Overview
1. **OSI model**: Understanding the layers and organization of the OSI model.
2. **Types of network**: Differentiating between LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
3. **MAC and IP address**: Exploring the concepts of MAC and IP addresses.
4. **UDP and TCP**: Understanding the differences and usage of UDP and TCP protocols.
5. **TCP and UDP ports**: Exploring commonly used ports for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
6. **Is the host on the network**: Creating a script to ping an IP address and check network connectivity.

## Requirements
- All scripts are written in Bash.
- Scripts should be executable and follow best practices.
- A README file is mandatory for the project.
- Ensure scripts pass shellcheck without any errors.
- Use comments within scripts to explain functionality.

## File Structure
- `0-OSI_model`: Script and questions related to the OSI model.
- `1-types_of_network`: Script and questions related to types of networks.
- `2-MAC_and_IP_address`: Script and questions related to MAC and IP addresses.
- `3-UDP_and_TCP`: Script and questions related to UDP and TCP protocols.
- `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`: Script for displaying listening ports.
- `5-is_the_host_on_the_network`: Script for checking network connectivity.

## Usage
To run each script, use the following command format:
```bash
./script_name [arguments]
```
Replace `script_name` with the actual script filename and provide any required arguments.
