# 0x0A. Configuration Management

## Overview
This project focuses on configuration management, DevOps practices, system administration, scripting, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). It includes tasks related to Puppet, a configuration management tool, and covers fundamental concepts and practical exercises.

## Background Context
During my time at SlideShare, I worked on an auto-remediation tool named Skynet, which monitored, scaled, and fixed cloud infrastructure. I utilized MCollective, a parallel job-execution system, to execute commands across multiple servers simultaneously. However, a bug in the code led to an incident where a mistaken action caused significant downtime. Thanks to Puppet, we were able to restore our infrastructure efficiently.
